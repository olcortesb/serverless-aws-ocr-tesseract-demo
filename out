{"statusCode":200,"body":"Mild Splendour of the various-vested Night!\nMother of wildly-working visions! haill\nI watch thy gliding, while with watery light\nThy weak eye glimmers through a fleecy veil;\nAnd when thou lovest thy pale orb to shroud\nBehind the gather’d blackness lost on high;\nAnd when thou dartest from the wind-rent cloud\nThy placid lightning o’er the awaken’d sky.\n"}
